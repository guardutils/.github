# GuardUtils

GuardUtils is a collection of small, reliable command-line utilities designed to make the terminal safer, friendlier, and more forgiving — without taking away the control and power that make it great.

## Why GuardUtils?

### Protect from common mistakes  
The command line is efficient, direct, and endlessly flexible — but also unforgiving.  
A single misplaced flag or command can delete hours of work or damage a system.  
**GuardUtils** introduces safety-first replacements and helpers that prevent irreversible actions before they happen, allowing you to work with confidence instead of caution.

### Keep it minimal  
Every **GuardUtils** tool does one job.
There are no background daemons, no hidden dependencies, and no unnecessary layers.  
Each utility can be composed, scripted, and extended the same way Unix tools have always been — predictably and transparently.

### Safety without friction  
**Guardrails** shouldn’t slow you down.  
**GuardUtils** tools integrate seamlessly into normal command-line workflows, adding protection without changing the way you think or type.  
You get a safer environment, not a different one.

### Learn without fear  
Beginners deserve tools that teach, not punish.  
**GuardUtils** makes the terminal more welcoming by reducing the cost of mistakes.
For experienced users, it removes the edge cases and late-night _“oh no...”_ moments that everyone eventually faces.

## Our Philosophy

**GuardUtils** exists to reinforce the Unix spirit: **clarity, simplicity, and respect for the user**.
It’s an ecosystem of open-source tools that make the terminal a better place to learn, to work, and to recover from the inevitable human moment.
